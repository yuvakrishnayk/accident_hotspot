### üîÆ Predictive Analytics

- Advanced AI/ML model trained on comprehensive historical accident data
- Real-time integration of traffic density, weather conditions, and road infrastructure
- Dynamic hotspot identification with risk scoring algorithm
- Temporal analysis for time-based risk variations

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Visualization

- Multi-platform application (mobile and web)
- Real-time alerts when approaching high-risk zones
- Customizable risk threshold notifications
- Alternative route suggestions for safer travel


### üí¨ Intelligent Assistant

- NLP-powered chatbot for instant information and assistance
- Voice-activated emergency reporting
- Contextual safety recommendations based on location and conditions
- Incident reporting and community safety contributions
